# Abstract

In this study, we developed a system to evaluate catching aptitude and conducted experiments involving athletes from both the open and closed skill domains. The study participants were classified into two groups: a high-skill group consisting of individuals with exceptional catching proficiency in open-skill ball sports and a low-skill group comprising those without catching training in closed-skill sports. The objective of this study was to ascertain the efficacy of a VR simulator as an instrument for discerning disparities in catching performance between two groups. The high-skill group exhibited superior rearward-catching capabilities and precise predictions of landing points compared with the low-skill group. These results suggest that a simulated catch system can be an effective means of measuring catch proficiency.
